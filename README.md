Doubts & Answers (It is a note for myself, don't need to read it):

    - How to generate a random output?

        Generated it with a combination of Math.floor and Math.random.

        let anyVar = [opt1, opt2, opt3]
        let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * anyVar.length)
        return anyVar[random]
